# 1 Overview

This outlines a threat model, a set of desired security properties, 
and a high-level system design for Aver.
In ensuring total privacy for communications and
collaboration, Aver helps individuals and teams work more freely and effectively.

This text proposes a system where no sensitive information 
(including all documents, and files) is ever stored, seen, or accessible to anyone except its
creator and their chosen collaborators. 

This is achieved using end-to-end encryption as
well as additional safeguards, including robust authentication
methods, out-of-band key verification (“mark as verified”),
and two-step authentication. 

At a more intuitive level, Aver uses the latest in privacy,
cryptography, and decentralization to keep users’ work and
personal data private and truly owned by each individual.
